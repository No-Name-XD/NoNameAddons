# NoNameAddons

## About

This is my first ChatTriggers module for Hypixel Skyblock. It includes various chat-related features such as:

- Party commands

- Dungeon messages and notifiers

- Some miscellaneous commands

I created this by combining and modifying features from existing modules like MeowAddons, AzuredClient, and others. I have never used JavaScript before this project, so the code may not be the most efficient, but it works.

## Features

- Party Commands: Useful chat-based commands. (!warp, !ptme, etc)

- Dungeon Messages & Notifiers: Automatically send important dungeon messages. (Mask Pop, Melody Terminal, etc)

- Miscellaneous Commands: Commands like !tps.

## Installation

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/No-Name-XD/NoNameAddons/releases/)

- Type `/ct files` or go to `%appdata%/.minecraft/config/chattriggers/modules`

- Extract the `NoNameAddons` (folder) into the (modules) folder

## Notes

This module is a personal project and is not optimized for efficiency.

If you find any bugs or have suggestions, feel free to contribute or report them.
